Why?
The FatKelly answers the most important question of any Fractional Share Trader: How much should I buy?
It is simple, and provably makes betting/investing better. Donâ€™t take just out word for it: Warren Buffett, Charlie Munger, Mohnish Pabrai, and Bill Gross, and other impressive financial types love it too.

How does it work?
The Kelly criterion is a time-tested formula for sizing bets or investments. The idea is simple, and has been called Fortuneâ€™s Formula: Given a sum of money to invest, allocate it in proportion to your edge/odds (The edge is the amount of gain Vs loss. The odds, the chances of a gain Vs loss). 

The FatKelly, is our extension of the traditional Kelly criterion. With two modifications:
1. We use Options implied win/loss probabilities and expected returns, and
2. Make fractional adjustment as a margin of safety to keep enough dry powder for the unseen opportunities ahead. 

How do I use it in my trading?
Itâ€™s a three step process:
1. Consider how much money you have to invest (the purse/cash youâ€™re willing to risk without FDIC insurance)
2. Source and screen available investments/bets on the basis of edge and odds (Options  data can help)
3. Pick the ones you like and use some type of modified Kelly to size the bet given your purse size
