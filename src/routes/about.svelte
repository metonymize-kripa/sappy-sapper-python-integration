        <p>Retail investors now account for almost one-third of market activity. Tactical trading has gone mainstream, and fractional.</p>

        <p>The tool helps source and size one week out tactical trades, by ticker and portfolio value. Learn more below about how Fractional Kelly sizing and Options data makes tactical trading smarter and safer.</p>
