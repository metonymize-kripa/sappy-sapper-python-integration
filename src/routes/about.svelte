        <h1>Options implied guidance for the Limit Trader</h1>
        <p>Some longer-term traders are comfortable waiting for a good deal. Limit orders help strategic investors willing to wait fish for "good fills".</p>
        <p>This tool helps size one week out limit trades. We use Options market premium to estimate the range of price movement, and use it to recommend Limit prices with a 1:5 chance of being filled.</p>
	<p>For orders that fill, the advantage Vs placing market orders can really add up.</p>
