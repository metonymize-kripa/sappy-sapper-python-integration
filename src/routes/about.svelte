<h1>About this site</h1>

<p>What is the shortest path to think of a stock ticker and know its price outlook? We are trying to answer that.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Context:</strong> Options data is complex, hard to turn into quick tradeable signals</li>
  <li><strong>Idea:</strong> FatNeo range, in seconds, takes 10 minutes of painful options chain analysis out; Comparable market solutions cost $$s/month</li>
  <li><strong>Use case:</strong> We've been testing it out to scope and trade options on our personal accounts in minutes (1 Wk ahead $20 GME Put when FatNeo range was $30-50, 1 Wk Covered Calls on MSFT, etc.)</li>
</ul>
