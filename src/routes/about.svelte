        <h1>Options implied guidance for the Limit Trader</h1>
        <p>Some longer-term traders are comfortable waiting for a good deal. 
		Limit orders can help such strategic investors with the patience to wait for "good fills".</p>
        <p>This tool uses Options implied volatility to inform one week out limit trades. 
		The Limit orders are set to have a 1 in 5 chance of being filled.</p>
	<p>For orders that fill, the advantage Vs placing market orders can be significant. E.g. 1-5% depending on market volatility.</p>
