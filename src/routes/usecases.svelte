<h1>Some of our use cases</h1>

<p>Options are just one of the many sources of insights that we make available for traders.
Here are a few use cases to inspire your exploration with our tools. Be bold. Hope you have fun!</p>

<h2><strong>Avoiding melt down</strong></h2>
<p>Using TICKER DOOM allows us to estimate the options implied probability of a sharp near term drop.</p>

	import { onMount } from 'svelte';

        <h4>Generating 20% yield from MSFT</h4>
      </header>
        You heard it right. Using fatneo, one of our users has been writing weekly covered calls on MSFT. He looks at the potential <a  href="/?symbol=msft&cmd=">one week range of MSFT</a> and writes weekly call outside that range.  He has made about $400 in a month (20% yield). If he keeps doing it for a year, he could make over $5,000.

        <h4>Making money on TSLA meltdown</h4>
      </header>
        TSLA has had a bad run during Feb. It fell over 30%. One of our users believed that the stock had hit the bottom. Using <a  href="/?symbol=tsla&cmd=kelly">fatneo's Kelly skill</a> he knew the probability of upside is more than 50%. The volatility was high and so he sold a weekly $520 put and made over $1,000.
