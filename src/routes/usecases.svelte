        <h4>Generating 20% yield from MSFT</h4>
      </header>
        You heard it right. Using fatneo, one of our users has been writing weekly covered calls on MSFT. He looks at the potential <a  href="/?symbol=msft&cmd=">one week range of MSFT</a> and writes weekly call outside that range.  He has made about $400 in a month (20% yield). If he keeps doing it for a year, he could make over $5,000.

        <h4>Making money on TSLA meltdown</h4>
      </header>
        TSLA has had a bad run during Feb. It fell over 30%. One of our users believed that the stock had hit the bottom. Using <a  href="/?symbol=tsla&cmd=kelly">fatneo's Kelly skill</a> he knew the probability of upside is more than 50%. The volatility was high and so he sold a weekly $520 put and made over $1,000.

        <h4>Profiting from the DailySpread</h4>
      </header>
        One of our users just shared a way to use our Kelly picks from the <a href="https://oracled.mailchimpsites.com/">DailySpread</a> to make money in a way that hadn't really occured to us until he shared it.
	Here's the tip, in his own words <i>"just because of my positions (i.e. didn't have the stock to call) but have been buying at, holding "until" and selling at the [covered]call position and it's worked 5 out of 5 times"</i>
